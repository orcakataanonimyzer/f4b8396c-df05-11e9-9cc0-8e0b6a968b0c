# How to Build and Run the Solution

I used NodeJS and Jest testing library to create my solution for this kata. If you are familiar with NodeJS and just need the command to run the solution, you can just type `npm test` into the command line. Otherwise, please follow my _Detailed Instruction_ below.

## Detailed Instruction

First of all, make sure that you have NodeJS installed on your machine. NodeJS allows you run JavaScript from the CMD/Terminal environment. You can get the instructions of downloading and installing NodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/

Once you have NodeJS installed and ready on your machine, you can go ahead with the following steps:

1. Open up your terminal or CMD (you can `cd` to your own workspace directory if you prefer)
2. Within the cli, you can start typing `git clone https://github.com/vud531/kata-pencil-durability` to clone the solution repository
3. After that, you can type `cd kata-pencil-durability` to go to the solution directory
4. Finally, you can type `npm test` to start testing the modules/classes with jest

You should now be able to view the test results in the terminal.
